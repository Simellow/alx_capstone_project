# ALX CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Project Overview:

Life, in many ways, can be seen as a series of interconnected tasks. From the mundane daily routines to ambitious goals, our existence revolves around accomplishing various tasks. These tasks could be as simple as making breakfast or as complex as pursuing a career, nurturing relationships, or creating art. We could all benifit from something like task manager to stay organized, track progress, manage time, and avoid getting overwhelmed by it all by breaking life down to chewable chunks. Itâ€™s like having a map for lifeâ€™s journey. ðŸŒŸ

The Task Manager App I will be working on is a web-based application designed to help users organize tasks efficiently.

**Task Completion** - Mark tasks as completed when they are done.

## The Task Manager App is built using the following technologies:

**LocalStorage** - To store task data locally in the userâ€™s browser.

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements

**User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
**Task Reminders:** Send notifications or emails for upcoming tasks.
